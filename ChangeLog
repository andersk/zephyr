	* configure.in: Check for X11/Xaw/Label.h.  If it's not found,
	don't build xzwrite.

	* aclocal.m4 (ATHENA_RESOLV_CHECK): New macro.  Check for
	__res_send as well as res_send.
	(ATHENA_KRB5_CHECK, ATHENA_KRB4_CHECK, ATHENA_HESIOD_CHECK,
	ATHENA_ARES_CHECK): AC_REQUIRE it, so we only include the code
	once.
	(ATHENA_KRB5_CHECK, ATHENA_KRB4_CHECK): Include $LIBS when trying
	to link.
	* acconfig.h (HAVE_LIB_RESOLV): Undef, since acconfig won't cope
	with the explicit definition now used.

2001-08-25  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in (h/config.h, h/config.h.in): New targets.
	(all): Depend on h/config.h.
	* acconfig.h (HAVE_SA_LEN): New macro.

2001-08-25  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in (VPATH): Define.
	(configure): Switch to srcdir before running autoconf.

	* configure.in: Check for ifaddrs.h.
	(KRB5_SOCKADDR_SA_LEN): Define and use.  Definition copied from
	krb5 tree.
